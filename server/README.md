## Overview

### The challenge

- Build a simple REST API for Devsources

## My process

### Built with

- NodeJS
- Fastify
- HarperDB

### What I learned

I learned how to build an API with NodeJS and Fastify, and how to store data using HarperDB.

### Continued development

Currently the API can only add new resources and get all the resources currently on the database.
I want to add the following functions:

- To login/signup
- Ability to comment on each resource
- To upvote a resource
- To edit a resource that you previously suggested
- To see your suggestions and ratings
